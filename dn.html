            Do you work/are you planning to work alongside your studies? What do you do in your spare time? How do you think
            you can combine this with studying?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I plan on starting work as soon as the second month of my studies so I can finance myself.
            For now in my spare time I play video games, read tech or science articles and relax at home.
            Given how much free time I have at the moment I think that I would easily merge fun with studying and working.
