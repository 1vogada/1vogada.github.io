                    My Motivation to study here
                </h1>
                <p class="text">
                    I choose this study track because ever since I was little, I have always had interest in computers
                    and the science behind them - from what makes that weird ticking noise(the hard disk) to what makes
                    a whole different universe appear on my screen(a game). It was only natural that I would want to
                    develop that interest further and so that was what made me
                    take up IT and Math in high school. Having graduated from high school with the same passion for IT,
                    I want to pursue a career with programming and ICT seems to be the best choice for me.
                    I choose Middelburg and Vlissingen because both of the cities are very close to the coast and I also like the Netherlands in general.
