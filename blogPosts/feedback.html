                    Motivation: What is it with computers and the science behind it that peaks your interest? can you
                    give us some more detail about it? And what made you decide upon Middelburg?
                    <br>
                    SWOT:

                    You say procrastination might be a threat. If I see how many other fellow students have handed in
                    there who am I form in late... I'd say your good ;-) Everyone has some areay he/she needs to work on
                    or take into account. How can some of your strengths for instance easily turn into a study sicces
                    threat and what can you do to not let that happen? One thing I can see in your swot for you to start
                    learning and work on is balancing workload , study, fun and relaxation. How do you do that? what do
                    you need for it and what can you put into place (or who because you need others too)
